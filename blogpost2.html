									<p>
										Yes, it's kind of a clickbait.
									</p>
									<p>
										There is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LukeBarousse" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> about data analytics with over 360K subscribers. This channel belongs to Luke Barousse. 
										In <a href="https://youtu.be/iNEwkaYmPqY" target="_blank">one of his videos</a>, he described a project which consisted of collecting a dataset of data analyst job postings, analyzing skills and salaries, and creating a web app where everybody can explore this data. 
										<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lukebarousse/data-analyst-job-postings-google-search" target="_blank">A sample of the collected dataset was uploaded to Kaggle</a>, and what makes it stand out, it stays relevant as it is updated daily. 
									</p>
									<p>
										After watching the video, I checked out the dataset and Luke Barousse's analysis. 
										I've decided to explore the question of popularity vs salary for the top skills required for a data analyst position. 
										So I created a python notebook with tiny data exploration and a simple treemap visualization. 
										<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/nesterenkojul/data-analyst-skill-worth/notebook" target="_blank">I uploaded this notebook to Kaggle</a>, and it was commented on by Luke Barousse himself! And he said he liked my work! 
										I know it may seem insignificant, but it was the first time my work got feedback from a professional in the field. As they say, 'you never forget your first'.
									</p>

									<p>
										Anyway, this post isn't really about the comment. Its main purpose is to show that I love positive feedback 
										<i>(actually, any type of feedback is a treasure)</i> 
										and sometimes I do stuff on Kaggle.
