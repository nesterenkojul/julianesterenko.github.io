									<p>
										Today marks the end of my 5-week <b>Consumer Insights Data Analytics Externship at Beats by Dr. Dre</b>. 
										It has been an amazing opportunity to boost my data skills by solving business conundrums of a worldwide-known audio company.
										My main goal as an extern at Beats' Consumer Insights team was helping the company 
										in understanding customer sentiments towards their products.  
										<br>
										Throughout the externship I've been conducting an 
										<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sVizfLyHkc-rslvJ5Q7Rc46sAG36oT__?usp=share_link" target="_blank">analysis of consumer sentiments towards Beats Flex Earbuds</a>. 
										I've performed exploratory, key word and sentiment analysis on a dataset of customer reviews from Amazon.com.
										Finally, I've presented discovered insights to the Beats team, highlighting key customer sentiments 
										and potential improvements for products and services.

									<p>
										All in all, the Beats experience have been extremely valuable. 
										I've been able to explore what it's like to work at a huge international company, 
										where the results of your work transform to business decisions that affect millions of people and cost millions of dollars. 
										Moreover, there have been tons of pleasant networking: from our extremely supportive program managers and Consumer Insights team members to
										fellow externs from all around the globe.
									</p>
									<p><i>
										It was also my first time participating in a focus group! 
										Such an empowering feeling when just by simply sharing your opinion
										you can play a role in changing a product used by millions of people.</i>
