										The first nuclear weapon was developed in the United States' Manhattan Project in the 1940s. 
										This decade was also marked by multiple strike waves and a rise of labor unions.
										Personnel of the nuclear project weren't excluded from these movements.
										Thousands of people, without whose input the creation of this weapon would not be possible, had to work in harsh working conditions.
										This project shows how they used work stoppages to fight for their labor rights.

										Christopher Nolan’s new film <i>Oppenheimer</i> tells the personal story of J. Robert Oppenheimer and depicts the development of the first nuclear bomb. 
										I was profoundly moved by this cinematic masterpiece. 
										What I always do with any emotionally touching subject is thorough research (aka googling). 
										In this case, I started digging for information about the Manhattan Project right after walking out of the cinema. 
										The hidden treasure was the <a href="https://www.osti.gov/opennet/manhattan_district" target="_blank">Manhattan District History</a> - a declassified report on the Manhattan Project. 
										The 8th volume of the first book contained information about the project’s personnel. 
										My attention was caught by a list of all work stoppages during the project. 
										As for me, it genuinely shows that the first nuclear weapons production was made possible with the labor of thousands of people. 
										I’ve decided to visualize all strikes throughout 4 years of the project with a “long” scrollable timeline/bar chart.
